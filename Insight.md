# *Land-price-prediction-Delhi*

The data set is provided by the (https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/housing-prices-in-metropolitan-areas-of-india) 

Now our project deals with the problems. 
->Prediction of the Land Price.
->Deployment for the user.
->Which machine learning algorithm to be used to get the get the good score.

# Prediction 

In this project we are basically using the Python (3.6) to be exact the library including 
->Numpy
->Seaborn
->Matplotlib
->Sklearn

STEP1: First step is the most impportant step as we are reading the data - set and checking if there is any null value.

Numpy = NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

Seaborn = Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

Mtaplotlib = Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK+.

Scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines.
